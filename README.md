# Yelp-Dataset-Recommender-System

- In this projetc, I analyzed a subset of reviews on Yelp using Bayesian topic modelling - Latent Dirichlet Allocation to analyze the topics and categories the reviews in broard categories. In order to build the recommender system, I used Collaborative filtering approach to built it. 

This recommender system will suggests restaurants to visit to various users by using the rank matrix. 


The code, output and analysis of the data can be found here: [Code](/Yelp_Data_Analysis.html)
